# 👋 Hi, I'm Rajdeep Sengupta

Cloud & Infrastructure Engineer  
I build systems that are predictable under load and boring to operate

---

## Focus

- Designing **cloud-native, failure-tolerant systems**
- Running **CPU-bound, high-throughput workloads** efficiently
- Making **cost, performance, and reliability trade-offs explicit**
- Reducing operational complexity through strong abstractions

---

## Core Skills

### Languages
- **Rust**, Go, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, and more…

### Cloud & Infrastructure
- **AWS**: ECS / Fargate, EC2, SQS, ALB, CloudFront, IAM, VPC, Route 53, WAF, and more…
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, declarative provisioning, and more…
- **Containers**: Docker, container orchestration patterns, and more…

### Systems & Data
- **Async & Queues**: Event-driven architectures, long-running workers, backpressure, and more…
- **Datastores**: PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, analytical & vector stores, and more…
- **Caching & Delivery**: CDN-first designs, TTL strategies, cache invalidation, and more…

---

## What Sets My Work Apart

- I design **for failure paths first**, not happy paths
- I treat **cloud cost as a first-class constraint**
- I optimize **CPU utilization, not instance counts**
- I prefer **simple systems that scale**, over clever ones that don’t
- I build infra that other engineers trust without thinking about

---

## Experience Highlights

- Architected **queue-driven worker systems** where each CPU core runs a long-lived task
- Built **simulation and data processing pipelines** with predictable throughput
- Designed **CDN-backed read-heavy systems** with minimal origin load
- Owned infra decisions end-to-end: design → deploy → operate → optimize

---

## Engineering Values

- Clarity over cleverness
- Observability before optimization
- Defaults should be safe
- Systems should explain themselves
